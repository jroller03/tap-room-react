## Component-Structure

![alt text](./src/assets/images/Component-Structure.png "Component Structure Diagram")

## Current features:

* There is a list/menu of all available kegs. Each keg has its name, brewer, price and alcoholContent.

* On the page you can see how many pints are left in a keg. (A full keg has roughly 124 pints).

* There is a form where a new keg can be added to the list.

## Future features:

* As an employee, I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake.

* As an employee, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1.

* As an employee, I want to be able to see kegs with less than 10 pints left so I can be ready to change them.

* As a patron, I want to have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability.

* As a patron, I want to use the alcohol content property to display stronger beers differently than weaker beers.
